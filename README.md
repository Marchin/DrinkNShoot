# Drink 'n' Shoot

<b>"Drink 'n' Shoot"</b> is an arcade-like, time trial first person shooter set in the wild west. You play as a cowboy who has drinking problems, 
but that is quite deadly with the gun. That's why your job will be to shoot the flocks of crows that threaten the peaceful little town.

This is a game (demo/protoype/vertical slice) developed by students from <a href="https://www.imagecampus.edu.ar/">Image Campus</a>.
